# Midnight Society Ranking
A Python program that collects and sorts Midnight Society NFT scores

The data is gathered from here: https://midnightsociety.com/founders_pass_json/1

The code basically gets all the JSON files for all 10000 NFTs and than adds up all the scores except Visor Cortex and Rarity Class' scores and then sorts it to a final JSON file
